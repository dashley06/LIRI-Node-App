# LIRI-Node-App
Week 8 Homework Assignment: LIRI Bot


LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that retrieves data from multiple databases and sources, based on input from the user. Using the Node Package Manager (npm) Axios to pull data from Bands in Town, Spotify, and OMDB, the user can search song titles or movies with LIRI.

LIRI is a command line node app, so the user must use of the following four command line prompts:
"concert-this" , "spotify-this-song" , "movie-this" , "do-what-it-says"

How to deploy this app:
Clone repo -
Run npm install -
In the command line, run node liri.js <one of the prompts from above>
